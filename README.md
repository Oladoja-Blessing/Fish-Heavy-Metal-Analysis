# Fish Metal Analysis

This repository presents the results of a contracted data analysis of heavy metal concentrations in **Hepsetus odoe** and **Parachana obscura**. The study covered both **monthly variations** (Mayâ€“October) and **body partâ€“specific accumulation** (gill, intestine, tail).

## ðŸ“Š Objectives
- Quantify concentrations of heavy metals (**Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb**) in fish tissues.  
- Explore temporal variation (monthly differences, Mayâ€“October).  
- Assess bioaccumulation across tissues (gill, intestine, tail).  
- Identify correlations between different heavy metals.  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- **Primary environment:** R (â‰¥ 4.0), RStudio.  
- **Key R packages:** `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `ggpubr`, `janitor`.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure 
- `results/` â†’ statistical summary tables and generated plots.  
- `scripts/` â†’ R scripts for analysis and visualization.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Summary of Results
- **Correlation:** Pike showed strong Feâ€“Pb correlation (r = 0.51), while Parachana had weaker overall correlations.  
- **Monthly Variation:**  
  - Pike had unusually high Cu and Ni in October and September, respectively.  
  - Parachana showed consistently stable Fe, with minor increases in Mn from Julyâ€“October.  
- **Body Part Accumulation:**  
  - Pike gills contained the highest Cu and Ni values.  
  - Parachana intestines accumulated more Fe compared to tail tissue.  
- **Notable Outliers:**  
  - Pike gills (October) had extremely elevated Cu (17.39 Â± 17.04) and Ni (33.19 Â± 33).
